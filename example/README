The chat client is an example client communicating
with a Project Darkstar server using the C client
library. The client is a simple chat program that
connects with the server constructed as part of the
Project Darkstar Server tutorial. The particular
server program is the Hello_Channels server.

Once the Hello_Channels server is started (see the
tutorial for instructions), the chat_client program
can be run. The chat client is a simple command-
line program that will connect to the server. If the
chat client is started with no arguments, it will
attempt to connect to a server on the same computer
that is listening on 1139 (which is the default
port for the tutorial server). The host and port
can also be specified on the command line, by using
the -h HOST -p PORT options (where HOST is replaced
with the appropriate host, and PORT with the
appropriate port). A full list of other command line
options can be obtained by running the program
with the "-u" option.

Once the program is started, it will print out the
host and port that it is attempting to use, and then
prompt the user for input. A list of the accepted
commands can be obtained by entering "help". The
user can log in to the server (use any login name and
password), send messages on the two channels that
are established on login, receive messages from
others send on those channels, or send messages
directly to the server. The user can also log out,
and quit the program.

Note that the commands to join and leave a channel
will only result in a confirmation from the server
that the command was received. Channels will not
actually be left or joined; this functionality has not
been implemented in the server.

The purpose of this client is to be an example of
how one can use the Project Darkstar C client. There
are no claims made as to the correctness or
aptness of the program; users are invited to enhance
or improve the example if they wish and submit
their code to the project for inclusion in a later
release.
